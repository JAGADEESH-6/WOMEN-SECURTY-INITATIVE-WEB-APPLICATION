TITLE: - WOMEN SECURTY INITATIVE WEB APPLICATION

In today's world, women often face numerous challenges and uncomfortable activities while traveling alone, ranging from harassment to serious incidents such as assault and attempted rape. Most of these incidents against women occur in unsafe zones while traveling. According to The National Crime Records Bureau’s (NCRB) annual report, there has been a harrowing surge in crimes against women in India, with a staggering 4,45,256 cases registered in 2022 alone, equivalent to nearly 51 FIRs every hour.

To address this critical issue, we introduce a web application with three key modules designed to create a safe environment for women’s before any attack occurs:

1.	Safe Navigational Directions and Routes: This feature suggests the safest routes from the user's starting point to their destination using data from crime statistics, traffic patterns, and public feedback.
2.	Nearest Law Enforcement Facilities: This feature helps users find the closest police stations or safe zones if they feel threatened or uncomfortable.
3.	Active Reporting System: This module allows users to report incidents in real-time through the application, providing valuable feedback for future safety improvements.

Our web application aims to make solo travel safer for women by providing tools for safe navigation, quick access to help, and efficient incident reporting. By leveraging technology and community support, we hope to create a safer environment for women on their journeys.
